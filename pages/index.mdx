##  Tolgahan Bora  


Hey, I'am **Full Stack Developer** at @Invio. Currently, I am working on the TestMore & TUBITAK Device Farm project. I enjoy working with **Typescript, React.js, Next.js** and crafting beautiful front-end experiences. I am passionate about using **Node.js, Express.js, and Supabase** to develop scalable backend systems. Currently, I am continuously improving my skills in both **AWS** and mobile development, specifically focusing on React Native & Expo.

I believe that balancing physical and mental pursuits enhances my performance and creativity in each project I undertake. I am a semi-pro bodybuilding athlete and chess player. I am an idealist and I do my projects with the **agile and kanban** development principle, including **Scrum**.
