##  Tolgahan Bora  

I am a Freelance Full Stack Developer with a strong background in **TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, and creating compelling front-end experiences**. Previously, I worked at @Invio, where I contributed to projects like TestMore and the **TUBITAK Device Farm**. Currently, I'm working on **Tasarlab** and **Marpera**, a high-volume budget management platform that handles ₺30M-₺100M monthly social media advertising budgets with real-time tracking capabilities. Through full-stack development of Marpera, I've achieved a 40% reduction in manual reporting efforts. I am passionate about building scalable backend systems using **Node.js, Express.js, and Supabase**. Currently, I am honing my skills in AWS and mobile development, focusing on **React Native & Expo**.

I believe that balancing physical and mental pursuits enhances my performance and creativity in each project I undertake. I am a semi-pro bodybuilding athlete and chess player. As an idealist, I approach my projects with the **agile and kanban development principles**, including **Scrum**.
