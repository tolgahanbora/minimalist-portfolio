##  Tolgahan Bora  


Hey, **Full Stack Developer** at @Cryptops. I enjoy working with **Typescript, React.js, Next.js** and crafting beautiful front-end experiences. I am passionate about using **Node.js, Express.js, and Next.js** to develop scalable backend systems. Currently, I am continuously improving my skills in both DevOps and mobile development, specifically focusing on React Native.

I believe that balancing physical and mental pursuits enhances my performance and creativity in each project I undertake. I am a semi-professional bodybuilding athlete and chess player. I am an idealist and I do my projects with the **agile and kanban** development principle, including **Scrum**.
